# capstone-project-1
Introduction - In This project we are creating a model which can help us to decide whether the person is infected by SARS-COV-2(COVID) through the analysis of CT_scan.
I have done this project on google colab.
First we have to explore the data and choose the type of algorithm , then prepare and clean the dataset. we resized the data show we can perform functions on it, we dropped some data so it helps in increasing the accuracy of model.
We imported many libararies. There are many methods but we used 'ResNet50'method.
Prepared dataset and perform train and test and at the end deploy the model
It was an very interesting and helpful project and i learned so many new functions.
